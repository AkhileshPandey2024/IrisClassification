# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification using ML Algorithms

This project focuses on building and evaluating multiple machine learning models to classify iris flowers into three species: *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica* based on petal and sepal features from the famous Iris dataset.

## 🚀 Algorithms Implemented

- 📈 Logistic Regression  
- 🌲 Decision Tree Classifier  
- 👥 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- 🧠 Support Vector Machine (SVM)

---

## 🧠 Objective

- To explore the Iris dataset and visualize feature distributions.
- To train and compare multiple ML models.
- To evaluate the performance of each classifier using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and F1-score.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Here's a pair plot of the dataset showing the relationships between the features:

Sepal and petal measurements show clear class separability, especially in petal length and width.

## 🔍 Model Evaluation

We compared all models using classification reports and confusion matrices.

| Model               | Accuracy |
|--------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression| 97.3%    |
| Decision Tree      | 96.0%    |
| KNN                | 96.6%    |
| SVM                | **98.0%** |
